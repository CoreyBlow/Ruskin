         <h3>Essays</h3>
            <br></br>
         
         <p>As an alternative to the indices, <i>essays</i> provide a pathway into the archive designed for readers who would benefit 
                        from a guided tour of the archive&#x02BC;s contents. The essays are topical surveys, which are richly hyperlinked to key works, manuscripts, and commentary. 
                        These discursive introductions are not meant to be exhaustive like the indices but to suggest significant points where a reader 
                        who is unfamiliar with the archive&#x02BC;s materials can gain a footing in selected topics. The topics planned for essays include:
                        
            <ul>
                  <br></br>
         
               <li>Editing and Bibliography</li>
               
               <li>Education</li>
               
               <li>Fine Arts</li>
