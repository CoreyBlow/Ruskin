         <p>Ruskin often formed texts into groups, by compiling anthologies of texts or organizing texts into a single composite work. 
                        In <i>ERM</i>, this kind of group is encoded as a <i>corpus</i>. Our aim in encoding and describing corpora is 
                        to express the forms taken by Ruskin&#x02BC;s anthologizing impulse, 
                        while complying with the TEI standards for XML 
                        (see <a href="../notes/editorial_rationale_note.php" target="_blank">Editorial and Encoding Rationale and Methodology</a>).

         </p>
         
         <p>Listed in the Corpora Index are titles of projects that Ruskin clearly developed as distinct corpora. The list includes titles that overlap with some 
                        found in the Works Indices, since Ruskin conceived of some groups of texts as a single composite <i>work</i>. Other titles in the Corpora Index are nearly coterminous 
                        with titles found in the Manuscripts Index, Ruskin sometimes using the physical boundaries of a major manuscript to help define a corpus. 
                        Indeed, in the encoding procedures of <i>ERM</i>, 
                        any major manuscript forms a kind of corpus, albeit a miscellaneous one, and can itself be made up of other corpora. Listed here, however, 
                        are manuscripts that Ruskin identified as distinct anthologies or composites.

         <p>Titles of copora default to an Apparatus Page, which in some cases is identical to a Work Apparatus, but which in other cases such as anthologies assembles 
                        information unique to a collection (e.g., title, contents, date, organizing themes, and other discussion). The Apparatus Page links to the corpus witness, in some cases 
                        multiple witnesses or corpora, that constitute a version or versions of the collection.
